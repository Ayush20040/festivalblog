        <h3>Importance of our festivals through economic perspective</h3>
           <p id="p1">Festivals are larger than life celebrations of various things. They occur at regular intervals and helping in breaking the monotony of life. Furthermore, they give you the chance to celebrate the little and big things in life. Festivals are the carriers of peace and joy in the communities. All nations of the world have certain religious and cultural festivals. However, India is one of the largest countries to celebrate numerous festivals. As India is a very cultural and diverse country, so are the festivals. They divide into three general categories of national, religious and seasonal.</p>

           <h4>Religious festivals</h4>

           <p id="p2">
            from all the festivals above mentioned "Religious" festivals of India play the most important role in the economy of India on both National and economical level.The economic benefits of festivals are easiest to see and most often cited - festivals attract visitors, which stimulate the growth of tourism and other businesses in a town or region. The social benefits of festivals are less visible, but they are just as important. It's fair to say that festivals foster community pride, teach people new things, and strengthen relationships. Events, fairs and festival tourism are one of the fastest growing forms of tourism. It is becoming increasingly popular in rural areas as a means to revitalise local economies. Let's for a moment, forget about the political reasoning and verbose, and focus on the pure economic impacts of the community festivals.

He said that the mindset of free India should be vocal for local to achieve the goal of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. We should appreciate, promote and use our local products.

            <h4>Vocal for Local</h4>
             <p id="p3">
                The basic meaning of Vocal for Local is to make local and use local also promote local products. This initiative will provide employment to the many people of that region and the local market will develop. After some time these local markets will progress so high that they will export their famous products in many countries across the world. If we use local products this will not only strengthen local identity but also boost economy of that area and of the country.  (essay on vocal for local).
